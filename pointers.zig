//		pointer_array_name: [*]u8 - An array of mutable pointers linking to 8 bit variables
//		pointer_array_name: [*]const u8 - an array of constant pointers linking to 8 bit variables
//		pointer_name - will show the memory address of the pointer

//		pointer_name.*. - accesses a member variable in the struct the pointer links to

	//A u8 is one byte, so (1 x 60) x 5 = 300bytes.
	//Now you have an array with 500 of these structs which is 150KB of data. If you want to print all of these in another 
	//function that's how much you would have to copy.
	//If you use a slice then a slice is a pointer, which is 64 bits, and a length which is probably the same.
	//16bytes vs 150KB, obviously the slice is preferable.

	//When you get a 'const char *' in c and c++, is it a single character? Is it an array of characters?
	//Is it a multidimensional array of characters?
	//You don't know unless you pass some other bits of information.

	//As a slice is a pointer with a length, you always know the size.

	Print("   values:\n", .{});
	//I'm not sure how you use a normal for loop with an array of pointers as the compiler says that 
	//pointer arrays have no upper bound so the loop goes forever.
	//Instead we use a for loop with the length
	const arrayLength = array.len;
	for (0..arrayLength) |index| //usize for the index
	{
		Print("   {}, ", .{arrayPointers[index]});
		//I have no idea why but we don't need to dereference array pointers.
		//I guess it's not possible to see the memory address directly.
	}
	Print("\n", .{}); //new line
	
	//Slices are still preferred over this
	//If you have an array of 50 elements and then creates a pointer array to that then 
	//a pointer is usually 8 bytes. 8 * 50 = 400bytes, whereas a slice would be 16bytes.
	
	//So most of the time you should use slices.
	//They are safer, as they have the length includes, can use for loop and are smaller.
