This is a project for anyone wanting to learn zig or who wants to see the code from my youtube tutorial series:
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-BgRHrP_sMpEvPImEbLrLKvx2Swci_6&si=aU6zC1ALZ2jf_ZhG

instructions:
-Download all the files to a folder  
-Open up a powershell or terminal in that folder  
-Run the command: zig run main.zig  

In the main file I have links to the other files. Simply comment and uncomment each section to view
the results from each section.
